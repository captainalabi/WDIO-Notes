1. TO RUN SPECIFIC SUITE OF TEST
INDICATE THE NAME OF THE SUITS IN WDIO.CONFIG AS FOLLOWS:

"scripts": {
    "test": "wdio",
    "actions": "wdio --suite actions",
    "login": "wdio --suite login"
  },

Actions and login are two suits declared above and you
run them with the commands indicated:

wdio --suite <suite name>

2. WHEN RETURNING A VALUE FROM WDIO
You can add await when returning a value from a WDIO
function by wrapping it along with the function in a
pair of brackets:

return (await function/expression)

3. USING DATA FILES IN YOUR TESTS
You can use data files to save variable names in your test
such as login username and password. 
In the file, you declare a module, export it and declare
your key:value pairs
Example:

export.module = {
username : "alabi"
password : "razaq"
}

Then, in your test, you access the values with the keys
But you need to import or require the file first and 
use keyword.key to access each value.
